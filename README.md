## Project Description <!-- {docsify-ignore} -->

Imagine is a CLI tool created in python to provide a way to easily create images, gifs, and videos. To achive this it provides a easy to use Lua API that provides drawing, utilites, exporting, and etc. The Lua API is inspired by the syntax/naming conventions of a popular JavaScript library called p5.js this allows users of p5.js to more easily integrate with the Lua API. Addionally the CLI tool also has multiple options to help assist you with getting the desiered output as easily as possible without you having to add a feature yourself.
